# Examples

This directory contains various examples demonstrating the usage of the `ndisapi-go` library. Below are the available examples:

- [Proxifyre](./proxifyre/README.md): An advanced example demonstrating a SOCKS5 proxifier implementation similar to [Proxifyre](proxifyre) C++ version.
- [Socksify](./socksify/README.md): A simple example demonstrating a TCP IPv4 SOCKS5 proxy implementation (`simple_packet_filter`).

Each example has its own README file with detailed instructions on how to build and run the example.
